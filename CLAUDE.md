# Kodama — agent guide

Kodama is a Windows desktop app (Tauri + Rust backend, React + Tailwind frontend, AGPL-3.0) that
turns meeting transcripts into routed, searchable Markdown notes, with Claude Code / MCP over the
knowledge base. Vision + architecture live in `docs/FOUNDING_DOC.md`; the working roadmap is
`docs/ROADMAP.md`.

Development runs on a **Kangentic board**, so how you create work and name branches matters.

## Creating tasks & branches

**Create board tasks with the `kangentic_create_task` MCP tool** — not the built-in todo system.
The board is the source of truth for work; a local todo list is not.

**ALWAYS pass `branchName`, formatted as `type/slug`:**

- `type` is a Conventional-Commit type: `feat | fix | chore | docs | refactor | ci`.
- `slug` is a short kebab-case summary. **No task ID.**
- Examples: `feat/scaffold-tauri-app`, `docs/frontmatter-schema`, `chore/adopt-git-flow`.

**Never omit `branchName`.** Kangentic ships no branch-name policy, so an omitted name
auto-defaults to `{slug}-{taskId8}` (e.g. `adopt-agpl-3-0-licen-5fa38daf`). That name **locks the
moment the task leaves To Do** (its worktree materializes) and **cannot be renamed** afterward
without desyncing PR tracking — `kangentic_link_pr` resolves PRs via `gh pr list --head <branch>`,
so a rename permanently breaks the link. Set it correctly up front; there is no clean fix later.

## Board flow

`Backlog → Planning → Executing → Code Review → Open PR → Done`

- **Manual gate between every stage** — a human drags each card onward. The one exception:
  **Planning → Executing auto-advances on plan approval** (plan approval *is* the gate there).
- **Executing** implements the task and **commits on the task branch — but never pushes.**
- **Code Review** is a fresh, independent session running `/code-review high` on `git diff main...HEAD`.
- **Open PR** runs the `/pull-request` skill: push → `gh pr create --base main` → `kangentic_link_pr`.
  **It never merges** — a human merges on GitHub, then drags the card to Done.
- **Never drag a card back to Backlog** — that kills the session and removes its worktree.
  "Request changes" from Code Review goes back to **Executing**.

Commit subjects follow Conventional Commits: `<type>: <imperative summary>`, matching the branch's
`type` (branch `feat/scaffold-tauri-app` → `feat: scaffold Tauri app shell`).
